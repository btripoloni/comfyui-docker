# Clones the ComfyUI Manager repository and checks out the specified tag; ComfyUI Manager is an extension for ComfyUI that enables users to install
# custom nodes and download models directly from the ComfyUI interface; instead of installing it to "/opt/comfyui/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Manager", which
# is the directory it is meant to be installed in, it is installed to its own directory; the entrypoint will symlink the directory to the correct
# location upon startup; the reason for this is that the ComfyUI Manager must be installed in the same directory that it installs custom nodes to, but
# this directory is mounted as a volume, so that the custom nodes are not installed inside of the container and are not lost when the container is
# removed; this way, the custom nodes are installed on the host machine
